## About

[MiniScript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) is a language for
composing Bitcoin [Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) in a
structured way, facilitating analysis, composition, and generic signing.
It\'s a simplified, composable subset of the Bitcoin
[Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) language. Developed to
overcome limitations in writing complex spending conditions directly in
Bitcoin [Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script), it enables formal
verification and offers a more human-friendly interface.

## Objectives

1.  Each `MinT` (MiniScript Template) [^mint] [^mintt] will provide a common MiniScript policy.

2.  Curate high quality example templates that demonstrate common use cases of
    [MiniScript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/master/src/script/miniscript.h)
    policies.

3.  Standardized implementations will establish best practices as well as promote uniform on-chain usage for better privacy.

4.  Each `MinT` will be provided as is. While care is taken to ensure a high degree of quality. Developers and enthusiasts assume full responsibility for their usage [^use-at-your-own-risk].

<!--

Submission policy question:

Can a developer submit a template
under a different license?
