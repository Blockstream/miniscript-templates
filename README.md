# Miniscript Templates


## About

[Miniscript](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) is a language for composing Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way, facilitating analysis, composition, and generic signing. It's a simplified, composable subset of Bitcoin's Script language. Developed to overcome limitations in writing complex spending conditions directly in Bitcoin Script, it enables formal verification and offers a more human-friendly interface.

## Goals

- Have reviewed templates that leverage miniscript to assure there are not unintended ways of executing a valid spend beyond the intended miniscript policy.
- Have standardized usages of miniscript to streamline software and hardware wallet integrations.
- Have uniform on-chain usage of miniscript templates for better privacy.
